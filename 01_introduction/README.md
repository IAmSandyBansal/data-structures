# Data Structures and Algorithms - Introduction

Data Structures are like containers that help us organize and store data in computer.

- **Efficiency**: Data Structures are optimized for different operations. For example, some data structures are faster for searching, some are faster for insertion or deletion.

- **Organization**: help organize data so that it is easy to use and understand.

- **Types of operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal (going through each element), searching, and sorting.

## Example of data structures

1. **Array**: Array is collection of items, each item in an array has a specific position, or index that you can use to access it. The first item is at at index 0, second item at index 1, and so on.

2. **Linked List**: Imagine a chain of paper clips. Each paper clip is connected to the next one in line. You can follow the chain from one clip to the next.

3. **Stack**: Think of a stack of plates. You add plates to the top, and you take plates from the top. Last in, first out.

4. **Queue**: This is like a line at the grocery store. The first person in line is the first to be served. First in, first out.

5. **Tree**: Imagine a family tree where each person is connected to their parents and children. This structure helps you see relationships.

6. **Graph**: Think of a social network where each person is a node, and each friendship is a connection. It shows relationships between people.

7. **Hash Table**: Similar to a dictionary where you look up words (keys) to find their meanings (values).

# What is an Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task. Data structures provide the framework for storing data, and algorithms are the methods used to manipulate that data efficiently.

## Examples of Algorithms for Different Data Structures

1. **Array**:

   - **Sorting algorithms** like **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort** organize the elements in a particular order.
   - **Binary Search** algorithm quickly finds an item in a sorted array

2. Linked List:

   - **Traversal algorithm** to visit each node in the list.
   - **Insertion and Deletion algorithms** are optimized by adjusting pointers to efficiently add or remove nodes.

3. Stack:

   - **Push algorithm** to add an element to the top of the stack.
   - **Pop algorithm** to remove the top element based on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

4. Queue:

   - **Enqueue algorithm** to add an element to the end of the queue.
   - **Dequeue algorithm** to remove an element from the front based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

5. Tree:

   - **Traversal algorithms** like **In-Order**, **Pre-Order**, and **Post-Order** for accessing nodes in specific sequences.
   - **Insertion and Deletion algorithms** to maintain the tree’s properties, such as those in a **binary search tree**.

6. Graph:
   - **Pathfinding algorithms** like **Dijkstra’s** or A (A-star)\* to find the shortest path between nodes.
   - **Traversal algorithms** like **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for exploring all nodes in the graph.
