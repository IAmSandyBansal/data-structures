# Complexity Analysis

The process of determining how effiecient an algorithm is in terms of **time** and **space** when the input size increases.

## Time Complexity

Time complexity measures how the **running time** of your program increases when the input size increases. We use **Big O notation** to describe how fast the time increases as the input grows.

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures how much **extra memory** the program needs as it processes more data. We usually express this using **Big O notation** to describe how much more memory the program will use when the input size increases.
